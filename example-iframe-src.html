            <h1>Reasonable.iframe</h1>
            <p>Reasonable.iframe is a tiny HTML document that contains a reasonable set of example elements. It was purpose-built for appearing within <a href="https://github.com/matthewhowell/reasonable.html">reasonable.html</a>'s example <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> element (hello!), which was purpose-built to test a set of classless CSS rules (<a href="https://github.com/matthewhowell/reasonable.css">reasonable.css</a>).</p>
            
            <p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe">Mozilla recommends</a> that <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> elements be styled with CSS, rather than HTML attributes.</p>
